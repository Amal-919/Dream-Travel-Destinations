  <h4><u>Here Are Some Places To Visit Once In A Life Time</u></h4></header>
<br>
<br>
<hr>What are the best places to travel? If you’re like most people, the allure of new horizons and uncharted adventures keeps you constantly adding destinations to your travel bucket list. Kuoni—a Britain-based travel company— recently did a study to rank the world’s best bucket list destinations.
<br>
    Kuoni conducted the comprehensive analysis by scouring Google search data for 119 bucket list places to visit in 219 countries. The results paint a vivid picture of travel aspirations, spanning from the breathtaking shores of the Maldives to the thundering majesty of Niagara Falls, encompassing iconic landmarks and awe-inspiring natural wonders along the way.<hr>

<br>
<br>
<p>Coming in at the top of the world’s best bucket list destinations is the idyllic cluster of islands known as the Maldives—which is known for its stunning white sands, bright blue waters and incredible sunsets. It topped the travel bucket list for 121 countries.</p>
<br>
<article>The Maldives is a popular destination known for its white sand beaches, turquoise waters, and underwater world.
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>Less than a fifth of the islands are inhabited</b></li>
        The Maldives is home to around 540,000 people, roughly the same amount of residents as Manchester. However, only around 200 out of the 1,200 islands in the archipelago are inhabited.
        
        A ban was introduced in 1984 on visiting the inhabited islands, but this was lifted in 2009 so visitors can experience the cultural side of the Maldives beyond the resorts and help the tourism industry.
        
        <li><b>It has only been a holiday destination for 50 years</b></li>
        The Maldives is a relatively new tourist destination, despite being around for a few thousand years! It was a secret destination for surfers and divers before the first resort opened in 1972.
        
        Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom gave tourism a huge boost during his first term in power and in 2019, 1.7 million tourists visited the Maldives.
        
        <li><b>The beaches are extremely rare</b></li>
        Next on our list of 10 facts about the Maldives is the pure white sand of the Maldives. It not only looks attractive but it’s actually made from coral. Coraline beaches make up only 5% of the world’s beaches, with most beach sand being made of quartz.
        
        <li><b>Shells were used as currency</b></li>
        Shells were used as a method of international trading currency in the 1800s, something which the Maldives had by the bucketload! These cowrie shells are distinctive, lightweight, and cannot be forged, making them an ideal money substitution. The shell-money trade is long since gone, and the cowrie shell is worthless these days, although it remains as the emblem of the Maldives Monetary Authority.
        
        <li><b>Swim with enormous fish</b></li>
        The Maldives is known for its variety of marine life, but the king of the waves here is the whale shark. The largest fish in the ocean, whale sharks can grow up to 20ft long, but you don’t need to fear a ‘Jaws’ type scenario as they live off a diet of plankton.
        
        If you want to spot these enormous beasts all year round, then head to the southern part of Sun Island’s reef on the South Ari Atoll. Other spots are Rangali Island and the uninhabited Hanifaru Bay.

        <li><b>The Maldives is the world’s lowest nation</b></li>
        The Maldives are merely eight feet above sea level at their highest natural point, which is lower than every other country on the planet. The 1,200 islands are on average around seven feet above sea level. The archipelago is protected from monsoon season swells by a natural barrier of coral reefs.
        
        <li><b>The Maldives held the first underwater cabinet meeting</b></li>
        One of the benefits of being the world’s lowest nation is being able to hold a cabinet meeting at the bottom of the sea! This is what Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed did in 2009 as a gesture for help over rising sea levels that would submerge some of the low lying areas by 2100.
        
        The 11 ministers signed a document calling for global cuts to carbon emissions, and their signed wetsuits were auctioned to raise money for coral reef protection. This is definitely our favourite 10 facts about the Maldives!
        
        <li><b>The islands have been inhabited for over 3,000 years</b></li>
        There is archaeological evidence to suggest that the Maldives had inhabitants as long ago as 1500 BCE.
        
        Before the Maldives converted to Islam in 1153 CE, Buddhists are thought to have arrived from Sri Lanka and settled briefly. For years, the islands had been used as a stopping point by Arab traders on their way to Asia, and many of them decided to stay.
        
        <li><b>Language</b></li>
        Although most Maldivians can speak English with no problems (and resort staff often speak a range of other international languages), the national language is Dhivehi. Why not learn a few phrases and words to impress the locals?
        
        Hello – Assalaamu Alaikum (from Arabic, meaning peace be with you)<br>
        Nice to meet you – Baddhalu vee thi varah ufavejje<br>
        Goodbye – Dhanee/Vakivelan<br>
        What is your name? – Kon nameh tha kiyanee?<br>
        My name is (name) – Aharenge namakee (name)<br>
        Yes – Aan<br>
        No – Noon<br>
        Please – Adhes kohfa (not commonly used as it means “I beg you”)<br>
        Thank you – Shukriyaa<br>
        You’re welcome – Maruhabaa<br>
        Excuse me – Ma-aaf kurey<br>
        Do you speak English? – Ingireysin vaahaka dhakkan ingeytha?<br>
        I don’t understand – Ahannakah neyngunu<br>
        Good morning – Baajjaveri hendhuneh<br>
        Good evening – Baajjaveri haveereh<br>
        Good night – Baajjaveri reygande<br>
        Good night (when you retire to bed) – Ufaaveri nidhumeh<br>
        
        <li><b>Weekends are different in the Maldives</b></li>
        Last but not least of our fact about the Maldives is the structure of the week. The weekend in the Maldives is on Friday and Saturday, which you might have experienced if you’ve visited an Islamic country, or been to Egypt, Jordan or Oman. This won’t affect your stay if you’re at a resort but factor this in if you’re planning to visit a local island as services may be reduced </ul>

<h2><li><b>Get Splashed At Niagara Falls</b></li></h2>

<br>
<br>
<p>In second place on the global travel bucket list: Niagara Falls, which receives an impressive amount of searches each year, as people hope to get up close to the incredible waterfalls located on the Canadian and American border.<br>
</p>
<article>
    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li><b>Three falls are better than one.</b></li>
    The fact that we refer to the Falls collectively as “Niagara Falls” leads many to believe that we’re talking about one giant waterfall when, in fact, there are three. The aptly named American Falls are on the U.S. side, as are the lacy Bridal Veil Falls; the Horseshoe Falls are almost entirely on the Canadian side. All three waterfalls can be experienced on the USA side of the Falls.
    
    
    
    <li><b>The Falls are young — geologically speaking.</b></li>
    Niagara Falls was formed from the same glacial-melt activity that formed the Great Lakes at the end of the last Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. That may seem like eons to us, but it’s just a blink of an eye in the grander scheme!
    
    
    
    <li><b>Speaking of the past: Niagara Falls is America’s oldest state park.</b></li>
    We have an impassioned group of environmentalists to thank for what is today Niagara Falls State Park. (One of those environmentalists? Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, of Central Park fame, who would later design the park). Troubled by the commercial activity occurring on the river, these saviors encouraged New York State to buy up the land surrounding the Falls to keep it safe from exploitation. As a result, in 1885, the park was established as the Niagara Reservation.
    
    
    
    <li><b>It’s not the tallest waterfall in America, but how big is Niagara Falls?</b></li>
    Niagara Falls’ vertical height is over 176 feet in some sections. That’s nothing to scoff at, but it pales in comparison to the continental United States' tallest waterfall, Yosemite Falls, which tops out at 2,425 feet. But what it lacks in vertical size, Niagara Falls makes up for in horizontal size, and in volume: More than 700,000 gallons of water per second pour over Niagara Falls, rushing over at about 25 miles per hour. That makes Niagara Falls the largest in North America by volume and by width.
    
    
    
    <li><b>Yep: That’s a lot of water!</b></li>
    Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie drain into the mighty Niagara River before emptying into Lake Ontario. Put the five Great Lakes together, and you get the world’s largest freshwater system.
    
    
    
    <li><b>It’s pretty powerful stuff.</b></li>
    Back in 1885, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse created the world’s first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls. These days, the Falls are capable of generating 4 million kilowatts of electricity, which is enough to supply more than a quarter of all the power used in New York State and in Ontario, Canada!
    
    
    
    <li><b>No wonder so many people visit!</b></li>
    More than 8 million visitors explore Niagara Falls State Park annually, coming from all over the world.
    
    
    
    <li><b>… which gives some people crazy ideas.</b></li>
    The first person to go over the Niagara Falls in a barrel was 63-year-old schoolteacher Annie Edson Taylor — she suffered only a concussion and a minor cut on her head. At least a dozen people have survived the plunge; numerous others have lost their lives. (By the way, stunting at Niagara Falls is illegal and includes hefty fines and possible jail time).
    
    
    
    <li><b>Fish, however, fare better than people.</b></li>
    Yes, fish do plunge over the Falls, and it’s estimated that almost all of them survive, thanks to their ability to flow with the water. Sometimes, however, they are a bit “stunned” after making the journey, but those who escape the circling seagulls shake it off and swim away.
    
    
    
    <li><b>Going, going …</b></li>
    The Falls were originally located seven miles downriver near what is now Lewiston; the brink has slowly eroded to its current location. Niagara Falls’ current erosion rate is approximately 1 foot per year and could possibly be reduced to 1 foot per 10 years due to flow control and diversion for hydro-power generation. Eventually, though — likely tens of thousands of years from now — they’ll disappear into Lake Erie.</ul></article>

<h2><li><b>Visit Bora Bora In French Polynesia</b></li></h2>
<br>
<img src="https://luxegetaways.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AdobeStock_600975100-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Bora Bora in French Polynesia" height="900" width="1200">
<div>French Polynesia-Bora Bora and Tahiti</div>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<p>Bora Bora, another tropical paradise, ranks high on travelers’ wish lists.</p><br>
<article>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
     <ul type="disc">
     <li>The original name for the Polynesian people of Bora Bora is Pora, which means “first born“.</li>
     <li>It is also known in Polynesia as Mai te pora, which means "created by the gods".</li>
     <li>You will no doubt have noticed that the difference between Bora and Pora comes down to a single letter. This happened because there is no “b” as we know it in their language, hence the change.</li>
     <li>Bora Bora was formed from what is known in geology as a volcanic hot spot. This means a point through which magma emerges through a volcano from the earth’s mantle and causes emerged regions to form above sea level. The same thing happened in the Canary Islands and the Galapagos Islands. Amazing, isn’t it?</li>
     <li>The capital and biggest population center of Bora Bora is Vaitape, located on the coast in the western part of the island. It has around 5,000 inhabitants, or roughly half the population of Bora Bora.</li>
     <li>The highest mountain in Bora Bora is the 2,385-foot-high Mount Otemanu. The elevation gain is considerable but you don’t need to climb to the top. There are several highly-recommended routes with interesting visits such as the Otemanu Cave.</li>
     <li>Bora Bora airport is not located on the main island but on one of the many small islands that surround it. It is called Motu (which means island) Mute and gives the airport its name. Remember that if you arrive in Bora Bora by air you will need to use a water transport service if you want to go to the main island or even to leave the motu.</li>
     <li>Bora Bora lagoon is a surprising place. For example, on December 5th 2018 the region’s armed forces disarmed ammunition that had been sunk in the lagoon since World War II. These types of activity are common in Polynesia due to the enormous influx of military forces into its archipelagos during World War II, so much so that there were seven such incidents between 2011 and 2018.</li>
     <li>Bora Bora has an extremely youthful population. Some 50% of the inhabitants are under 30 and it was even younger a couple of decades ago when the proportion of youths in the population exceeded 60%.</li>
     <li>There is a very high probability that you will visit Bora Bora if you travel to French Polynesia. It should be mandatory. Bora Bora, in fact, is the second most-visited island by tourists who come to the Society Islands, preceded only by Tahiti. Specifically, 101,609 tourists visited Bora Bora in 2014, only 18,719 fewer than those who visited Tahiti.</li>

    <p>“The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and opportunity,” Paton affirms. Best way to experience it: Climb to its crown for panoramic views of the city skyline.Gifted by France to the United States in 1886, Liberty Lighting the World, commonly known as The Statue of Liberty, stands 93 meters above Upper New York Bay. <br>
        She has come to symbolize freedom and opportunity for immigrants arriving by sea seeking new opportunity, and is a triumphant symbol of American identity for those at home. The Statue is recognized worldwide, but did you know the following 5 facts? Scroll on to tour and learn...</p><br>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>The statue represents a Roman Goddess</b></li>
            
            The statue's name derives from the Goddess it represents; Libertas, a Roman deity personifying freedom. Libertas appears on Roman coins from the period of Julius Caesar's assassination, supporting the Republic. Here, you're free to click and point to approach the statue by water.
            
        <li><b>The crown's spikes represent the oceans and continents</b></li>    
            
            The statue's crown bears seven spikes, symbolizing the seven oceans and seven continents of the world, and emphasizing her message of welcome, inclusiveness, and freedom. Can you spot her from here, on nearby Ellis Island, many new Americans' first stop in their new life?
            
            
        <li><b>Lady Liberty is struck by lightning 600 times every year</b></li>
            
            Standing proud, exposed to the elements, the statue has to withstand around 600 lightning bolts every year and, in high winds, the torch can sway by about 5 inches side-to-side! Luckily, it's a clear day as we land here at the ferry terminal and approach.
            
            
        <li><b>Gustave Eiffel helped to build it</b></li>
            
            Edouard de Laboulaye was the man who dreamt the statue up, and sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi designed it, but the integral metal framework was made by the same man who built the Eiffel Tower! You can appreciate their work from here in Flagpole Plaza, or get closer...
            
            
        <li><b>Lady Liberty's face is modelled on the artist's mother</b></li>

    <p>The northern lights are one of the most mesmerizing natural wonders you can witness firsthand.<br>
        The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are mesmerizing ribbons of light that have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Despite their serene beauty, this breathtaking display results from a highly energetic and turbulent process.</p>
        <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>The Ancients Thought the Northern Lights Were Fire</b></li> 
            
            For thousands of years, no one knew exactly what the Northern Lights were or where they came from. Aristotle made the first scientific account of the lights in the 4th century BCE, likening them to flames of burning gas. In the thirteenth century CE, the first detailed attempt at explaining the lights was made in Konungs skuggsjá, or The King’s Mirror, a Norwegian educational text. The theory was that the lights were reflections from Earth’s oceans. Another theory was that they were reflected sunlight coming from below the horizon, lighting up the sky. Even fires in Greenland were speculated as being the cause of these mysterious lights.


            <li><b>An Aurora in Europe Sparked Aurora Borealis Insights</b></li>

            In 1708, Swedish scientist Sun Arnelius suggested that solar rays were being reflected off ice particles into the atmosphere. Eight years later, a strong aurora in Europe lead to more scientific research being conducted on what cause the lights. Sir Edmund Halley published the first detailed description of the Northern Lights, suggesting that, “Auroral rays are due to particles, which are affected by the magnetic field, the rays parallel to Earth’s magnetic field.”
            
            
            <li><b>The Northern Lights Continuously Encircle the North Pole</b></li>

            In the 1800s, Christopher Hansteen set up observation stations and arranged with sea captains to record the Earth’s magnetic field. Hansteen become the first person to note that the aurora occurs as a continuous ring around the geomagnetic pole. Taking this finding forward, Danish astrophysicist Sophus Tromholt organised a network of northern lights observation sites from which he discovered that the lights formed a ring around the North Pole.
             
             
            <li><b>Earth’s Magnetic Field Guides the Northern Lights</b></li> 

             At the start of the 20th century, the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland conducted an experiment in which he placed a spherical magnet inside a vacuum chamber, then shot an electron beam at it. Birkeland found that the beam was guided by the magnetic field, hitting the sphere near the poles. He then reasoned that the sun must be firing beams toward Earth, and it was Earth’s magnetic field that guided them near the poles.


            <li><b>Trapped High-Energy Solar Particles Make Up the Aurora Borealis</b></li>

             In the 1930s, Sydney Chapman and Vincent Ferraro hypothesised that clouds of electrically charged particles fired from the sun fly across space and envelop the Earth. Further research showed that as the particles reach Earth, they go around the atmosphere. The majority of them fly past the Earth, while a few swirl back toward it and enter the atmosphere. With the dawn of the Space Age, satellite data showed that the space around Earth is filled with high-energy particles that are trapped by the Earth’s magnetic field. Data revealed that there was also solar wind. These findings enabled scientists to create a map of the magnetosphere.


            <li><b>Northern Lights Solar Particles Move Millions of Miles Per Hour</b></li>

             Today we know the Northern Lights are created by solar flares that shoot through space out of the sun. Specifically the lights originate from collisions between gas molecules on the surface of the sun, releasing large quantities of matter and electromagnetic radiation. The speed at which the solar flares normally travel is around seven million miles per hour (11,265,408 kph). At this speed, the solar flares take anywhere from one to five days to reach Earth, depending on the speed of the solar wind. In comparison, sunlight takes eight minutes to reach Earth. As the solar flares reach the Earth’s atmosphere, the majority of the particles continue past Earth into space. However, a few solar flares enter the atmosphere from east to west, above the magnetic poles.


            <li><b>The Northern Lights Are Diffuse <i>(Soft)</i> or Discreet<i>(Sharp)</i></b></li> 
             
             Most auroras occur in a band called the auroral zone, which is at a 3- to 6-degree latitude from the geographical poles. The Northern Lights can be either diffuse or discrete: Diffuse auroras form a featureless glow that may not be visible to the naked eye, while discrete auroras have sharp features and can vary significantly in brightness.
             
             
            <li><b>Auroral Breakups Bring the Northern Lights to Life</b></li>
             
             The most spectacular part of watching the Northern Lights, and a common passenger wish on both Greenland cruises and Svalbard cruises around Spitsbergen, is seeing the auroral breakup. This event involves a brightening of forms and a rapid change in the aurora. The lights go from plain to rayed before swirling and dancing in the sky. In fact, multiple breakups can happen on a single night of moderate to high activity, while a low-activity night will have one or two breakups.Scientists advise viewers to stay put if they see multiple bands appearing in an area, as that means a breakup is likely to occur. If these bands are seen early in the evening, the breakup will most likely be spectacular, with many more to come. After a big breakup occurs, there may not be any activity for half an hour to an hour, and breakups themselves can last around that long.
             
             
            <li><b>Aurora Borealis Colors Come from Gas and Electrons</b></li>
             
             The colors of the Northern Lights are dependent on gas and electrons in the atmosphere. High-energy electrons cause oxygen to emit green light, while low-energy electrons cause a red light. Nitrogen typically gives off a violet or pink color, while vertical blues are caused by electrons colliding with ionised nitrogen.Another factor that determines the color formation is altitude. At high altitudes (over 105 miles, 170 km) reds are generated, at middle altitudes (60 – 105 miles, 95 – 170 km) green is generated, and at lower altitudes (50 – 60 miles, 80 – 95 km) pink and violet are generated. When there are large solar storms, red can occur at the lower altitudes.The color variations are due to oxygen taking around a second to emit energy as green light, and up to two minutes to emit red light. Higher altitudes contain a greater percentage of atomic nitrogen, giving atoms plenty of time to emit red, while the pinkish colors are a result of red from oxygen and blue from nitrogen combining.
             
             
            <li><b>Practice Makes Perfect Northern Lights Pics</b></li>
            
            When taking that perfect photo of the Northern Lights, first check the weather and visit a website for aurora forecasts. A clear sky free of light pollution is as important as having the moon out of range, though some photographers prefer the moon for natural foreground lighting. Another factor is proximity to water, as an aurora over sea or lake can provide an amazing reflection.For this type of photograph, a wide-angle zoom lens is advised. With exposure times ranging usually from 20 – 30 seconds, it is recommended that your camera be secured to a tripod. Also, try not to breathe out in awe while looking through the viewfinder, as this can cause the lens to fog and leave condensation that might later freeze. This might take some practice, but the results will be worth it

<div>Stonehenge in England</div>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<article>
    <p>Stonehenge in southern England ranks among the world's most iconic archaeological sites and one of its greatest enigmas. The megalithic circle on Salisbury Plain inspires awe and fascination—but also intense debate some 4,600 years after it was built by ancient Britons who left no written record.</p><br>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>Stonehenge World Heritage Site is huge</b></li>

            The Stonehenge part of the World Heritage Site covers 2,600 hectares (6,500 acres) of chalk downland and arable fields. It’s an area seven-and-a-half times as big as Central Park in New York City.
            
            The circular bank and ditch around Stonehenge itself encloses an area of over 10,000 square metres.
            
        <li><b>The average Stonehenge sarsen weighs 25 tons</b></li>
            
            The largest stone, the Heel Stone, weighs about 30 tons.

            To give people an idea of how massive the Stonehenge stones actually are, there’s a replica sarsen stone behind the visitor centre in the outdoor gallery. It’s an exact copy of a freestanding upright from one of the iconic trilithons that form an inner horseshoe at Stonehenge.
            
            We scanned the stone using a laser as part of a wider survey in 2011, then used the 3D data to create this huge replica. It wasn’t possible to use a real sarsen stone as there are none of the size used at Stonehenge left anywhere, and most natural sarsen spreads are protected by law today.
            
            More things to see and do at Stonehenge
            
        <li><b>Some of the stones are even bigger than they look</b></li>
            
            2.13m of Stone 56, the tallest standing stone on the site, is buried underground – in total it measures 8.71 metres from base to tip.
            
        <li><b>The bluestones travelled 240km to Wiltshire from South Wales</b></li>
            
            They were brought from the Preseli Hills in south-west Wales, probably largely by boat.
            
        <li><b>Around 180 generations have passed since the stones were erected at Stonehenge…</b></li>
            
        <li><b>People were living at the site long before Stonehenge was built</b></li>
            
            The reconstructed head on display in the visitor centre is based on a real man. His skeleton was excavated in 1864 from a long barrow near Winterbourne Stoke roundabout.
            
            Reconstructed-Head-Final.jpg
            
            The history and significance of Stonehenge, the landscape, and its people are explored in the visitor centre – which is where you can see this reconstruction.
            
            Radiocarbon dating has shown that he died between 3,630 and 3,360BC – around 500 years before the first earthwork enclosure was built at Stonehenge.
            
        <li><b>The five Neolithic Houses are based on real dwellings</b></li>
            
            The five structures were built based on archaeological evidence of houses found at Durrington Walls. Each one had a chalk floor, a hearth and stake-built walls. Some had evidence of furniture and of chalk cob walls.
            
            Neolithic-Houses-blue-sky-hig-res.jpg
            
            The Neolithic huts at Stonehenge are based on archaeological evidence found at nearby Durrington Walls
            
            Radiocarbon dating has shown that these houses were inhabited for about 50-100 years in around 2,500 BC, exactly the time that the sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge.
            
            The closeness of the dates raises the distinct possibility that the people who occupied the houses at Durrington were involved in the construction of the sarsen stone settings and in celebrations at Stonehenge.
            
        <li><b>You can see 15 minutes of someone’s life 5,500 years ago in the main exhibition</b></li>
            
            In front of a tool-box displaying the Early Neolithic toolkit, there is what looks like a lump of grey flint with a single detached flake. If you look carefully, you can see that it is in fact many individual flakes fitted back together.
            
            About 5,500 years ago, someone present during the construction of the ditches at the Stonehenge Cursus, crouched in the ditch and expertly hammered (‘knapped’) a flint model. This was how every flint tool began life: the flint-knapper would strike the nodule carefully to make the shape of the axe, scraper or arrowhead. Flakes or long narrow blades of flint would be struck off – which could also be used as sharp cutting tools. The whole process of knapping probably took about 15 minutes.
            
            This time, nothing was used – the nodule was completely destroyed and every flake was recovered when the ditch was excavated in 1992. You can see it in detail online here.
            
        <li><b>Women and children were at Stonehenge too</b></li>
            
            Recent analysis of the cremations buried at Stonehenge has found that men, women and children were buried here in the late Neolithic period, between about 3000 and 2500 BC.
            
            grape-cup.jpg
            
            This beautiful grape cup is on loan to the Stonehenge visitor centre from Wiltshire Museum, Devizes
            
            Several high status women were buried in round barrows near Stonehenge nearly 3,000 years ago. One was held in particularly high regard by her community because she was buried with precious objects.
            
            Amongst her grave goods was this exquisite little cup, which may once have held a light and been used in the funeral rites. It’s one of 250 objects on display that were discovered within the World Heritage Site, that are predominantly on loan to the Stonehenge visitor centre from Salisbury Museum and Wiltshire Museum.
            
        <li><b>Stonehenge was bought at an auction in 1915</b></li>
            
            It was purchased for £6,600 by local business man Cecil Chubb, who (reportedly) came to the auction to buy some dining chairs.

            Three years later Chubb gave the monument to the nation, to be cared for by the then Ministry of Works. A series of major restorations and excavations took place from 1919 to 1929, and another major programme between 1958 – 1964.
            
            There has been extensive work over recent years so that now Stonehenge sits within a restored landscape, which gives a sense of its original setting.

<article>
    <p>Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, this UNESCO World Heritage site is one of the world's most iconic architectural marvels and has been drawing visitors to Agra, India for hundreds of years. Standing majestically on the banks of River Yamuna.Taj Mahal is famous for Own beauty and one of the wonders of the world.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>Labor of decades</b></li> 
            It took 22 years and around 22,000 people to build the Taj Mahal. It’s said that over 1,000 elephants were used to transport necessary construction materials. It cost about 32 million of Indian currency to build at the time of construction.


        <li><b>Gem of a monument</b></li>

About 28 different varieties of precious and semi-precious stones, brought from different parts of Asia, were inlaid into the white marble used to construct the Taj. The marble was brought from Rajasthan, blue stones from Tibet, emeralds from Sri Lanka, jasper from Punjab and crystals from China.



        <li><b>Cultural amalgam</b></li>

The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. The construction began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen.


        <li><b>A fine balance</b></li>

All the four pillars of Taj Mahal were built to slant away from the monument slightly so that if the pillars ever collapsed due to natural calamities, like an earthquake, the main monument would be protected.


        <li><b>The number game</b></li>

UNESCO named the Taj a world heritage site in 1983, and it has long maintained a position in the seven wonders of the world. Over the years, there have been many attempts to ‘sell’ the Taj Mahal. In fact, Mithilesh Kumar Srivastava, better known as Natwarlal, was a noted Indian conman known for repeatedly ‘selling’ the Taj Mahal.


        <li><b>Black and white</b></li>

It’s been said that Shah Jahan wanted to construct an identical back Taj Mahal on the other side of the river, which was meant to be his own tomb. But he wouldn’t be able to, as he was imprisoned by his son Aurangazeb. However, the base of the black marble Taj Mahal can still be seen across the river.


        <li><b>Seven feet under</b></li>

Mumtaz Mahal, in whose memory Shah Jahan had built the Taj, was kept in a mummified form until the monument was complete. Four minarets frame her tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chambered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.


        <li><b>Color play</b></li>

The white marble of the Taj reflect the colors of the sky, depending on the time of the day. It appears pink in the morning, white during the day, and golden in the moonlight.


        <li><b>Into the night</b></li>

Visiting hours of the Taj Mahal are sunrise to sunset and it’s closed on Fridays. But, on full moon nights, visitors are allowed between 8:30 p.m. and half-past midnight for 30 minutes.


        <li><b>Thumb tax</b></li>

It’s said that Shah Jahan had ordered the thumbs of all workers to be cut off immediately after the construction of Taj Mahal because he wanted no one to be able to recreate such a marvel anywhere in the world. However, nobody has been able to prove this story true.

    <h2><li><b>Visit Cinque Terre In Italy</b></li></h2>
    <br>

    <div>Cinque Terre; Italy</div>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    <article>
        <p>Along the Italian Riviera, Cinque Terre is a collection of five pretty villages perched on cliffs connected by hiking trails and a scenic railway. It is a string of five ancient fishing villages perched high on the Italian Rivier just south of Genoa in northwest Italy.</p>
        <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Its Name Makes Sense</b></li>

We’ll start with the most basic of facts, just in case you didn’t know…The Italian words ‘cinque terre’ literally translate to ‘five lands’, which of course refers to the five villages:

Riomaggiore
Manarola
Corniglia
Vernazza
Monterosso
So, now you know!


<li><b>It Used to Be a Secret</b></li>

One very surprising fact you might enjoy is that prior to the 1970s, this stunning area was actually a fairly well kept secret. While the Italians always knew of its appeal, of course, and it wasn’t completely devoid of international tourists, it wasn’t until an American journalist fell deeply in love with the place (and who doesn’t?) and included it in a guidebook that the rest of the world really caught on.

<li><b>It’s a Car Free Zone</b></li>

How much more relaxed would the world be without having to contend with traffic? Well you’ll be pleased to know that this particular little part of the world is. All five of the villages are car-free, which makes them so much easier and more pleasant to get around when you’re exploring on foot. Joining our Cinque Terre day trip from Florence means you won’t have to worry about driving and parking anyhow, but for those who do, there is provision to park in La Spezia and take the train or walk between the villages.


<li><b>The Water Here is Somewhat Special…</b></li>

Those lovely aquamarine waters that roll in and lap the shores of the villages are definitely something special to look at, and even better when you dive in for a dip. But there’s also something else that makes them special: the unique biome of the water in the protected harbours of the villages is extremely rich and nurturing for a variety of marine life. It’s why the fishing here is so prolific and the seafood is absolutely superb. Anchovies are a particular speciality, so make sure you try them.


<li><b>It’s Home to Amazing Pesto</b></li>

It might not be unique to the area, but the much-loved herb basil is in delicious abundance here and is somewhat of a signature flavour. It pops up all over the place in the cuisine – from salads and freshly baked focaccia, to the classic pesto sauce for pasta or sandwiches. (Buying a jar to take home is also a great souvenir of your Cinque Terre day trip from Florence.) But the most unusual use of basil is in gelato – and believe us, once tried it’s never forgotten! In a good way, of course. The local tip is to choose a combination with a berry flavour to compliment a scoop of basil gelato.


<li><b>You Don’t Have to Hike</b></li>

For many people, hiking along the coastal trail that links the five villages is a kind of pilgrimage and a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ thing to do. If hiking is not possible or desirable for you, there are alternatives that can be just as enjoyable. The train that travels between the villages will get you there in a fraction of the time (also good if you’re on a tight schedule) and there are also opportunities to take a ferry, when weather permits.


<li><b>It’s UNESCO Protected</b></li>
The entire area is designated a National Park and it has also come under protection as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1997. There are very strict regulations for both locals and visitors (you need a special day permit to hike), so when you come on our Cinque Terre day trip from Florence it’s very important that you take notice when your guide tells you what is and isn’t allowed. The National Park encompasses not only the five villages but also the hills behind them and the actual coastline itself.


<li><b>It Has a Very Long History</b></li>

There are historical documents on the region dating back to the eleventh century, but there’s evidence it was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age. Historians refer to the important part this section of coastline played in the geographical strategy of the Roman Empire and, later, the Saracens. Vernazza and Monterosso were the first towns to be established and the others flourished under the rule of the Republic of Genoa. All this wonderful history has left its mark on the diverse styles of the architecture of the churches, monasteries, villas and fortifications.


<li><b>One of the Towns is Not Like the Others</b></li>

While Monterosso, Vernazza, Manarola and Riomaggiore are all built into the edge of the coastline, with houses that hug the slopes right down to the ocean, the village of Corniglia is perched high on the very edge of a cliff. For some people, this makes it the most dramatic of the five, and even though there’s no beach you can take the steps right down to the bottom of the cliff. Just remember though, if you go down, you’ll have to come back up again…

The fantastic Cinque Terre day trip from Florence is one of our most popular here at Walkabout Florence, and it’s a place you can return to again and again and still not get enough. There’s so much more to know about this wonderful part of Italy and we can’t wait to share it with you.

<h2><li><b>Visit Cappadocia</b></li></h2>

<br>
<br>
<article>
    <p>Cappadocia is a great place to visit, known for its unique geographical formations, fairy chimneys, valleys, and historical structures</p>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
       <li><b>The Name ‘’Cappadocia” Dates Back To The 6th Century, And Its Origin Means “Low Country”</b></li>

While many writings on the internet say that Cappadocia’s meaning is “The Land of Beautiful Horses,” that’s not the case. The region’s name actually dates back to the 6th century BC, and kings Xerxes and Darius I was the first people to make records of the name on the trilingual inscriptions. Initially, the locals referred to it as Katpatuka, which means “Low Country.” The Iranians referred to it as Hu-apa-dahyu, which literally means, “The Land of Beautiful Horses,” and since horses played a significant role in the history of the region, it makes sense some people still refer to it as “The Land Of Beautiful Horses.”


       <li><b>The Magical Rock Formations In Cappadocia Were Created Through A Series Of Volcanic Eruptions Millions Of Years Ago</b></li>

The Central Anatolian area suffered a series of volcanic eruptions millions of years ago. The result is the Cappadocia friaries. The thick ash solidified into the tuff, which eventually transformed into the gorgeous chimneys we see today, thanks to the Water erosion and wind that washed over them constantly. Standing at about 130 feet high, these tuffs may change in shape in many years to come because they still undergo water and wind erosion. These are some of the things one should see in the world at least once in their lifetime.


        <li><b>Goreme Has Undergone Four Name Changes In The Past</b></li>

Goreme is a village with a population of about 2,000 residents and is one of the few ancient settlements that remain inhabited. It is famous for Turkey’s fairy chimneys, which are millions of years old and still perfectly preserved. It is also home to amazing hot air balloon rides and numerous boutique hotels that provide unforgettable accommodation experiences in Cappadocia. Originally, Goreme was known as Avcilar, which means “Hunters.” The name was then changed from Avcilar to Maccan to Matiana and then to Koreme. Years later, during the Turkish Republican era, its name changed to Goreme.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Is Home To Numerous Churches And Monasteries</b></li>

Cappadocia is one of the most important worship places for Christianity in the world, and between the 10th and 11th centuries, the region saw numerous constructions of monasteries and rock-hewn churches. Many of the ancient churches were beautifully adorned with extraordinary ornaments. There are more than 600 churches, and more could be discovered. When exploring some of these churches, vacationers will marvel at the gorgeous frescoes that, though they have suffered destruction due to constant erosion, have managed to retain their beauty and color.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Was First Inhabited In The Third Century</b></li>

Cappadocia’s first human settlement dates back to the 3rd century, during the Paleolithic Era. The Hatti tribe settled here between 2500 and 2000 BCE. Assyrians also lived around the same period, and Cappadocia became an important trading center among the people. It also served as a refuge for people who suffered persecution because of their religion. For thousands of years, this region became home to numerous monks. Discoveries that prove human settlement have been found in the region, including Neolithic pottery.


        <li><b>The Hot Air Balloon Ride Offers The Best View Of Cappadocia</b></li>

Wondering what’s it like to see Cappadocia Turkey from a hot air balloon? Hot ballooning is the most popular activity in Cappadocia, and tourists can enjoy the fun rides in Goreme. While biking and hiking offer an opportunity to discover the stunning landscape and help discover more beautiful secret spots that only the locals know about. But Cappadocia hot air ballooning is the best way to see dazzling ancient landscapes. It allows tourists really take in the beauty of the landscape, including the unforgettable views of the Cappadocia skyline.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Is Home To A Good Number Of Underground Cities</b></li>

The impressive Cappadocian underground cities are among the unique experiences to not miss during a visit to the region. Some of these subterranean settlements are connected by a network of narrow tunnels. The region boasts about 36 underground cities, Kaymali and Derinkuyu being the most popular and visited of them all. Dating back to the 8th century BC, Derinkuyu was discovered by one of the local settlers while renovating his house. The city's depth is about 85 meters and must have been able to accommodate more than 20,000.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Is Home To An Open-Air Museum</b></li>

Cappadocia is known for its incredible open-air museum, which is located in Goreme. Goreme Open-Air Museum is one of the most visited and popular tourist attractions in the area. The museum, among other rock sites in the area, was the first in Turkey to be included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1985. The museum features a beautiful church by the side, which makes it look like a monastery. Every traveler must always make a stop at this gorgeous museum because it is one of the fun things to do in Goreme.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Is A Large Grape Producer And Has A Long, Fascinating History Of Wine Making</b></li>

Thanks to the volcanic tuff, Cappadocia is a large grape producer and boasts a long, fascinating history of wine-making. Being a popular destination for its unique rock formations and hot air balloon rides, many vacationers limit their trips to these activities and forget that this region is also incredible for its wine. Some of the wineries to explore in the area include Kapadokya, Turasan, Kocabag, and Senal. Some of the most popular red and white wine brands are from this region, and tourists can sample a few in wine-tasting shops.


        <li><b>Cappadocia Is Not Just A Treat For Its Unique Landscape; It Also Offers Numerous Fun Festivals To Catch</b></li>

While many vacationers visit Cappadocia for its unique landscape, it also hosts numerous exciting festivals, and some would be perfect for families. Some of them celebrate music, while others appreciate the local artists and the fantastic culinary scene. Cappadox is a festival that combines international and contemporary art with food and music. It happens every June. Another festival not to miss is the Cappadocia Music Festival, which takes about a week and is held in places like churches, caves, courtyards, and other magical spots.
